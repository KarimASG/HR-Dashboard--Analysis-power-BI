# HR Dashboard  using power BI
 üöÄ HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI: Driving Data-Informed Decisions üöÄ  I‚Äôm excited to share some insights from our recent HR analytics project! Using Power BI, we developed a dynamic dashboard to analyze employee demographics, performance, satisfaction, and turnover. Here‚Äôs how we leveraged the data to gain actionable insights for workforce planning and employee engagement:  üìä Key Insights from the Dataset: Employee Demographics and Compensation:  Age and Compensation: We identified trends in how compensation scales with age and tenure. Interestingly, departments with higher average ages also showed a correlation with higher daily rates, suggesting that experience plays a key role in pay progression. Monthly Income vs. Monthly Rate: We calculated the average income-to-rate ratio, revealing departments where income closely matches or exceeds allocated monthly rates. These insights can help in resource allocation and budgeting. Attrition Analysis:  Attrition by Age and Department: We analyzed attrition rates across age groups and departments, identifying segments with higher turnover. This data will help guide retention strategies by focusing on departments with higher attrition. Factors Affecting Attrition: Using relationship satisfaction, environment satisfaction, and job satisfaction metrics, we pinpointed key drivers of attrition, giving HR a roadmap to improve engagement and reduce turnover. Education and Job Role Alignment:  Education Levels in Job Roles: We explored the alignment between education levels and job roles across departments. Departments like R&D and Life Sciences showed a high concentration of employees with advanced degrees, which aligns with the expertise required in these fields. Performance and Education: We noticed that higher education levels in certain fields corresponded with higher performance ratings, suggesting a strong link between education and performance outcomes. Workplace Satisfaction Metrics:  Job Satisfaction by Department: The dashboard highlighted departments with lower-than-average job satisfaction, allowing HR to target specific areas for improvement. Relationship Satisfaction: We observed that employees with high relationship satisfaction scores also had higher performance ratings, underscoring the importance of workplace relationships in employee productivity. üõ†Ô∏è Technology & Methodology: Using Power BI, we were able to create a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that combines visuals with drill-down capability, enabling real-time data exploration. The insights we gathered are invaluable for guiding HR strategy, enhancing employee experience, and supporting data-driven decision-making.
